ofxFiducialFinder
================
ofxFiducialFinder tracks fiducial-tagged objects using ofxOpenCv. It's like an openFrameworks-based TUIO addon, done without messages. Tested with 0.8.4 in OSX 10.8.5


Note
---------
I didn't make this addon. It was created by Alain Ramos a.k.a. ding (http://forum.openframeworks.cc/users/ding)

I dug it up in this thread: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/offiducialfinder/486 

Refactored the code a tiny bit and got the example sketch running.


Installation
--------
Clone/extract the addon into your openframeworks/addons folder. Ensure it is named "ofxFiducialFinder"

Create a project with the project generator and add ofxFiducialFinder and ofxOpenCv.
